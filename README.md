**Short:** this repository contains *educational* password lists composed of entries 8 characters and longer. These files are provided **only** for defensive, research, and learning purposes (password-strength testing of systems you own, security training, academic research, tooling development). No passwords are supplied for—or intended for—unauthorized access.
